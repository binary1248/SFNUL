1. INSTALLING

SFNUL requires a compiler with C++11 support. Not all features are used, however
many newer features are used that might not be supported by all compilers even
though they claim C++11 support. Your mileage may vary.

Dependencies:
 - ASIO (standalone C++11 version) provided in extlibs as a submodule
 - TropicSSL (last BSD licensed release of PolarSSL/XySSL
 - http-parser
 - SFML 2.x for the optional SFML synchronization example (http://sfml-dev.org/)
   Initialize all submodules with
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   in the root directory.
   ASIO is provided under the Boost Software License.
   TropicSSL is provided under the Modified BSD License.
   http-parser is provided under the MIT License.

The build system in use is CMake (http://cmake.org/). It's available for all
major platforms.

To build, perform the following steps:

 - cmake .
 - make install (as root)
 - On Linux: ldconfig (as root)

2. USING SFNUL IN OWN PROJECTS

To use SFNUL in your projects, you have to link to the SFNUL library (see 1.
for building). Also make sure that your compiler is able to find SFNUL's
include directory.

If you're using CMake for your project and you've properly installed SFNUL (see
1.), you can automate the process of finding SFNUL. At first copy the file
cmake/FindSFNUL.cmake to your CMake's module directory. Then add the following
to your project's CMakeLists.txt file:

  find_package( SFNUL REQUIRED )
  include_directories( ${SFNUL_INCLUDE_DIR} )
  add_executable( my_program ... )
  target_link_libraries( my_program ... ${SFNUL_LIBRARY} )

In case CMake can't find your SFNUL installation, you can still specify the
path manually by setting the SFNUL_ROOT CMake variable.

Keep in mind that you still have to link to SFML 2.0 (at least system and
network).

Because SFNUL makes use of the operating system's networking subsystem, be sure
to link the necessary networking libraries to your final application as well.

3. DOCUMENTATION

You can find the API documentation in the doc sub-directory. Create it with
Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).
